## This will be purely based on demand
##COPY  .env /opt/safe-settings/

## This can probably be removed, but users will have to make sure they
## run the container, then copy the key. This helps avoid that for folks
## using this in their enterprise environments
#COPY --chown=node:node .ssh/safe-settings.pem /opt/safe-settings/.ssh/

# We need Python for Probot
USER root
RUN apk add --no-cache make python

## Not strictly necessary, but set permissions to 400
#RUN chmod 400 /opt/safe-settings/.ssh/safe-settings.pem /opt/safe-settings/.env

## Install the app and dependencies
RUN npm install

## This app will listen on port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

## Best practice, don't run as `root`
USER node

## This does not start properly when using the ['npm','start'] format
## so stick with just calling it outright
CMD npm start
